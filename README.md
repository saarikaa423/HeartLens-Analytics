Concept of the Project:
In the realm of healthcare, predicting diseases before they manifest can be a game-changer. It can lead to early interventions, better management of health conditions, and improved patient outcomes. To this end, we propose the development of a Disease Prediction Model using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. This model will analyze various health parameters of an individual and predict the likelihood of them developing a specific disease. The parameters could include age, gender, lifestyle habits, genetic factors, and existing health conditions, among others.

Problem Statement:
Develop a Predictive Model using Machine Learning to forecast the likelihood of an individual developing a specific disease based on their health parameters.

Objective of the Project:
The primary goal of this project is to enhance preventive healthcare through early disease prediction. The objectives include:
1. Facilitating early detection and treatment of diseases.
2. Assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
3. Empowering individuals to manage their health proactively.

Data Sources Used:
Publicly available health datasets from platforms like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.

Data Analytics Software Used:
Python Libraries used:
1. Numpy - for complex mathematical operations.
2. Pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn - for data visualization.
4. Scikit-learn - for implementing machine learning algorithms.
5. Streamlit - for website design.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
1. Na√Øve Bayes
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. K- Nearest Neighbors
4. Logistic Regression
